# CWC-Wicket-Notifier
Python script to notify the user everytime a wicket falls in CWC matches.  
Everytime a wicket falls, the script first plays an MP3 through the speakers to notify the user. Then adds the data about the current runs, wickets and overs to a JSON file for further use, if required.  
**This is something I wrote for fun and might not work in the future**
